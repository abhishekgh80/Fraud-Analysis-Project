# Fraud-Analysis-Project
Overview:

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent activities using data analysis and machine learning techniques. Fraudulent activities, especially in financial transactions, can result in significant monetary losses. By analyzing transaction data and identifying patterns, we can build predictive models to flag suspicious transactions and help prevent fraud.

Problem Statement:

Fraudulent transactions pose a significant challenge for businesses, especially in the banking and financial sectors. The goal of this project is to analyze transactional data and build a robust predictive model to distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.

Objectives:

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and anomalies in transaction data.

Build and evaluate machine learning models for fraud detection.

Identify the most significant features contributing to fraudulent activities.

Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

Data Analysis: pandas, numpy

Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn

Machine Learning: scikit-learn, XGBoost, imbalanced-learn

Model Evaluation: precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

Jupyter Notebook for implementation.



Steps/Workflow:

1. Data Collection & Cleaning:

Load the dataset and preprocess it.

Handle missing values, if any, and outliers.



2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze feature distributions.

Visualize class imbalance (legitimate vs. fraudulent transactions).

Use correlation heatmaps and box plots to find anomalies and relationships.


3. Feature Engineering:

Evaluate feature importance.

Scale numerical features such as transaction amount and time using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler.



4. Model Building:

Train multiple machine learning models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)


5. Model Evaluation:

Evaluate models using key metrics:

Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC Score.


Use a confusion matrix to analyze true positives, false positives, and false negatives.


6. Model Comparison & Insights:

Compare model performance and choose the best-performing model.

Summarize key findings and observations.




Results:

Best Model: Random Forest achieved 99% precision and 98% recall for fraud detection.
